## Potion 

###  Introduction 

This Vim plugin  provides syntax highlighting for Potion files (which end in .pn).  It also implements folding support, and commands such as `zM`, `zR` and`za` will work with .pn files.  In addition, the plugin affords functionality for the section movement commands `[[`, `]]`, `[]` and `][`

After installation, run `:help potion` for further information. 

### Mappings 

Potion defines two convenient mappings 

​	`PotionCompileAndRun()`            

​	Bound to: <localleader>r

This function, as the name suggests, compiles and runs a Potion 
file from within vim. The potion-example folder contains an example 

Potion program, `factorial.pn`, which may be executed from within vim

using the above mapping

​	`PotionShowBytecode()`

  	Bound to: <localleader>b

This function shows the bytecode generated by the Potion compiler
in a separate vertical-split window.  Check it out using the example (`factorial.pn`) provided in the potion-example folder
